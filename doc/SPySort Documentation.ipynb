In the case where the user would like to use the SPySort's methods to load its data he or she has to take into account the fact that the raw data must be in plain binary format. SPySort does not yet support reading other formats such as HDF5. Here we examine the case where the user decides to use the SPySort's methods. In the demonstration case below we have already the data available on our machine. If you would like to get the data you can use the following commands before performing any further analysis."
